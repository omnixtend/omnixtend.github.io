# OmniXtend: Scalable Memory Disaggregation over Ethernet

Welcome to the official documentation site for **OmniXtend**, an open and scalable memory interconnect architecture designed to enable **cache-coherent memory disaggregation** over standard Ethernet infrastructure.

OmniXtend connects CPUs, accelerators, and memory modules using packet-based communication, enabling flexible system composition and efficient resource sharing across nodes. This site provides a comprehensive guide to OmniXtend's architecture, hardware, software stack, and use cases.

## 🔍 What is OmniXtend?

OmniXtend is an open memory interconnect protocol that:
- Uses standard Ethernet to build coherent memory systems
- Supports TileLink as its coherence protocol
- Enables disaggregated memory access across compute elements
- Scales from embedded systems to datacenter environments

It is especially suited for:
- Machine learning workloads requiring large memory pools
- Edge computing clusters with shared memory
- Open hardware research and experimentation
